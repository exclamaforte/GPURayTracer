GPU Raytracer written using [GPU.js](https://github.com/gpujs/gpu.js).

The kernal functions are limited to fixed length loops and conditionals, so there is a fixed bounce number for light beams.

Created for the Parallel Programming class I took while studying abroad at National University of Singapore.
